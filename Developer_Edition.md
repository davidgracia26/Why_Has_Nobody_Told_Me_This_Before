# Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before (Developer Edition)

This repo is a collection of things I would hope someone would tell me about if I was started web dev today.

<br/>

> ## Developer Environment

Most people use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is made by Microsoft so it has great support behind it. It supports HTML, CSS, and JS out of the box. Support for most languages can be added via [extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#:~:text=VS%20Code%20extensions%20let%20you,APIs%20used%20by%20VS%20Code.).

If you don't feel like installing things on your computer, you can use [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) which allows you to set up an environment quickly as long as all you need is Javascript or a Node environment. And if you have an account you can save your setup for future use.

[Replit](https://replit.com/languages/csharp) is a good resource if you need to test a server side language's code in addition to javscript.

If you're looking for a good place to play around with C# then [Dot Net Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) is a great place to test your code.

> ## Front End Resources

This was the first book I read on HTML & CSS: [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/html-and-css-jon-duckett/1111446793?ean=9781118008188)

This was the first book I read on Javascript: [JavaScript and jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/javascript-and-jquery-jon-duckett/1119294449?ean=9781118531648)

<br/>

### **Layout of HTML**

The ease of arranging things with CSS has grown over the last few years. Grid and Flexbox are two of the biggest reasons why.

1. [Complete Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
1. [A Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
1. [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - a game to learn flexbox
1. [Codepip also has several other CSS and HTML games to help you learn](https://codepip.com/games/)

<br/>

### **Javascript is the most used programming lanuage in the world**

1. [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/resources) - I suggest [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) and [You Don't Know Javascript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
1. [Mozilla Foundation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - has docs for HTML, CSS, and Javascript
1. [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/) - the most popular front end library in use right now
1. [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) - a very popular library that has pre-built components
1. [Apollo client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) - used in conjuction with GraphQL

<br/>

### **This is the Way aka Road Maps**

> ## Back End Resources

The bleeding edge of .Net is .Net 7 but having .Net 6 is good enough at the moment because it is well supported.

[Dot Net Core Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/aspnet-core/)

If you're building an API you're going to want to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) which allows you to write collections of tests for your endpoints. It can also be used for GraphQL.

[What is my API telling me?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status). Deciphering HTTP status codes is half the battle when determining what happened with your code.

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) allows you to create a graph layer that can be queried and mutated. It is a way to move towards version-less APIs. Less breaking changes = faster development and happy consumption by outside users.

[Hot Chocolate](https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate) is the weapon of choice for use with C# and GraphQL.

<br/>

> ## Where to Go When You Have Questions

You may find refining your [Google searches](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en) will help with what you're looking for. I sometimes use the extra query terms but usually asking questions Google can understand will help bring back what you need. It's all about keywords. 

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is written in with .Net on the back end. It is the place to go on the internet if you have any question about development. If you have a question, there is a good chance someone has asked it before. The best answers are upvoted and appear near the top.

Each year Stack Overflow publishes a [developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/) which includes information about emerging and stale technologies and salaries.

[O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/search/?q=books&type=article&type=book&type=journal) has some great books to help you learn and they're written by some of the best in the industry.

[dev.to](https://dev.to/) is a good place to go if you want to showcase your knowledge and is also a good place to look for examples of how things are done by other devs. It has grown in popularity over the last 5 years.

> ## Advanced Topics

At some point you are going to want to put your code outside of your computer and in the cloud. [Getting Started with Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources) will help with how to put your code for others to see or just keep it in a safe place in case your computer dies. Here is some more advanced [Advanced Git](https://git-scm.com/) topics but usually Visual Studio Code will take care of all the actions for you with buttons instead of having to write commands.

For version control (having a history of your code), most people either use:
1. [GitHub](https://github.com/) which is owned by Microsoft 
1. [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) which is owned by the same people that make Jira aka Atlassian
1. [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
